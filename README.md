### Installation

We're using [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) for packages installation:

```
yarn install
```

Application is accessible on `http://127.0.0.1:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Docker container

### Build

Run `yarn ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

### Running unit tests

## Releasing

### Bumping releases

We're using [version-bump-prompt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/version-bump-prompt) for increasing version.

Install `version-bump-prompt` via:

        npm install -g version-bump-prompt
        
If you would like to bump prepatch just type:

        bump --prepatch --tag --push
        
### Distribute release

We have got configured CircleCI, TravisCI and AppVeyor for distributing application for particular platform. In order to release you need to tag&push your changes.

Using `bump`:

        bump --patch --tag --push

Or manually:

        git tag v0.0.1
        git push origin v0.0.1
        

When artifacts are made you can see draft release here: [gns3-web-ui releases](https://github.com/GNS3/gns3-web-ui/releases) which is waiting to be published.
After release please change current version in `package.json` to `X.X.X-beta.0`'. Otherwise artifacts will be overwritten during the next commit. 

You may use `bump` to achieve that:
      
        bump --prepatch

### Staging release

In case you would like to create a new staging release. Please create draft release on github, like `0.0.1-dev1`. After successful build you can find artifacts there.
