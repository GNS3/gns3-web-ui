## Releasing

### Bumping releases

We're using [version-bump-prompt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/version-bump-prompt) for increasing version.

Install `version-bump-prompt` via:

        npm install -g version-bump-prompt
        
If you would like to bump prepatch just type:

        bump --prepatch --tag --push
        
### Distribute release

We have got configured CircleCI, TravisCI and AppVeyor for distributing application for particular platform. In order to release you need to tag&push your changes from master.

First of all please remove `dev` from version in `package.json` (for instance `2019.2.0-alpha.4dev` to `2019.2.0-alpha.4`). Commit & push changes with message `Release 2019.2.0-alpha.4` . Next step is to tag repository and push to origin:


        git tag v2019.2.0-alpha.4
        git push origin v2019.2.0-alpha.4
        

When artifacts are made you can see draft release here: [gns3-web-ui releases](https://github.com/GNS3/gns3-web-ui/releases) which is waiting to be published.
After release please change current version in `package.json` to `2019.2.0-alpha.5dev`'. Otherwise artifacts will be overwritten during the next commit. Don't forget to commit & push changes.

#### Updating gns3server

Checkout the latest master of `gns3server`. Run command `./scripts/update-bundled-web-ui.sh --tag=v2019.2.0-alpha.5`. Commit & push changes with message `Release 2019.2.0-alpha.4`.

### Staging release

In case you would like to create a new staging release. Please create draft release on github, like `0.0.1-dev1`. After successful build you can find artifacts there. 

### Updating signing certificate for Windows

Please follow this guide: [code-signing](https://www.electron.build/code-signing), use `certmgr.msc` exporting tool to limit the size of certificate.
